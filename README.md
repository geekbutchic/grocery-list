# `Grocery List`

Objective: I will be creating a grocery list with two possible stretch goals or both.

### `Features:`
* Be able to add food products to the list.
* Cross out the food items when in shopping cart.
* Remove the items completely.

### `Stretch Goals:`
Feature 1 
* I really enjoy fruit and have them everyday.  I found a really neat API https://www.fruityvice.com/#3 that provides valuable information that I would like to incorporate into the `todo` list.
*  `/api/fruit/{ID} or /api/fruit/{name}`
*  Example `api/fruit/apple`
*  This json array appears.
```javascript
{
    "genus": "Malus",
    "name": "Apple",
    "id": 6,
    "family": "Rosaceae",
    "order": "Rosales",
    "nutritions": {
        "carbohydrates": 11.4,
        "protein": 0.3,
        "fat": 0.4,
        "calories": 52,
        "sugar": 10.3
    }
```
Feature 2
* Add a calculator to the grocery list to keep track of the total amount you will spend.

Final Project 
* My intention is to complete the application that is mobile friendly, useful, and meets the minimum requirements with at least one stretch goal.
